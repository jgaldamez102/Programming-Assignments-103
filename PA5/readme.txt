================================ Remarks ====================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.

Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?

:2 Days (but not that many hours )
*USED ONE SLIP DAY*

Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially useful to
know if you turned it in incomplete.

: there are alot of different moving pieces with the vectors that it was
pretty difficult to keep track of where they all go. overall though, it was 
making sure you understood how to use them, and how to deal with private 
variables.

Do you have any other remarks?

:This was NOT easy, but i actually really liked doing it.
