Saying "a CP on Tuesday" is ok if you don't remember their name.

:Google and some of the BFS slides tended to make the most sense

================================ Remarks ====================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.

Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?

:a long time just to understand it

Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially useful to
know if you turned it in incomplete.

:when running the test cases, everything works. however, when 
running users_large.txt through option9 , the vector somehow doesnt 
take in the values coming into it, and leave it as 0. I ran gdb and 
did it exactly how its done in test_suggest_friends, but alas nothing 
worked. If you know what Im tlaking about, please tell me what I am doing
wrong

Do you have any other remarks?

:love this project, hate how hard it was
