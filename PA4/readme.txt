NOTE: You can delete the questions, we only need your responses.

NOTE: It is helpful if you write at most 80 characters per line,
and avoid including special characters, so we can read your responses.

Please summarize the help you found useful for this assignment, which
may include office hours, discussion with peers, tutors, et cetera.
Saying "a CP on Tuesday" is ok if you don't remember their name.
If none, say "none".

: Office hours definititely helped in understanding how to use north
south east and west objects to understand how to flow through using the 
search algorithm
=============================== Prelab ==================================

1. What data structure will you use to remember which cells have
already been added to the queue or not?

: a (dynamic) 2D array that has been initialized beforehand.

2. At what step of the BFS algorithm do you have to mark a cell as visited?

:you have to mark it visited it once it has been dequeued. 

=============================== Review ==================================

1. Describe your "mymaze.txt" test file. It should have multiple paths
of different distances. When you ran your program on it, did your program 
behave as expected?

:Yes it did, as i had a long path that still made it to the finsih line, 
but it obviously found its way using the shorter one

============================== Remarks ==================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.

Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?

:4-5 Days

Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially 
useful to know if you turned it in incomplete.

:understanding BFS in a pretty short amount of time. 

Do you have any other remarks?

:i love the algorithm, i just feel like if i didnt know the 
algorithm beforehand, it would be very difficult to spend time learning
